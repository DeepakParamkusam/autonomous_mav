##General Rules  
Best Practices vary from environment to environment. We shall try to follow few rules to keep the code running at all times, and smooth transitions. A few practices to keep in mind are:  
  
  1. Commit Often: As soon as you have a wokring code or made changes to a code and when it works, commit!
  2. Comment your commit: For every commit you make, add a line, even if it is just few words, so that others understand what has been changed.
  3. Fetch : Everyday when you start working on your code, before you start, use Fetch to know if someone has made anychanges, and you can start from the latest point. 
  4. Push less often: Push to the main repository, when you are sure about the code and when the team members agree that the code is working and updated. 
  5. Code, code and code. Have fun Coding!
